Erdos Quant Finance - Summer 2025

**Overview:**

In the age of machine learning methods in the computational sciences, methods such as pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and the handling of large datasets have become extremely relevant in quantitative finance. In this collection of mini projects, we use various methodologies in statistics, time series analysis, and machine learning to analyze stock data as well as explore common models in financial theory. This README serves to walk through each mini-project, highlighting key methods, results, and insights.
